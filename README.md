In this project, I have implemented the fetch-execute cycle for a custom CPU. Alongside the implementation, I am also able to step through any assembly file on the simulator and see how the values in memory and registers are changing as each assembly instruction is executed. The architecture for this CPU is a very simplified version of the x86 architecture designed by Intel. The CPU is a 32-bit system and has 8 registers total. The only type of data we will be working with are 32-bit integers.
